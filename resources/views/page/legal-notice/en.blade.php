                    <p>
                        The Controller is exempt from any kind of liability arising from the information posted on their website, as long as this information has been manipulated or entered by a third party not belonging to said site.
                        <br><strong>Linking policy</strong>
                        <br>Users may be redirected to content of third-party websites from the website. Since the Controller cannot always control the content entered on its website by third parties, the Controller accepts no responsibility for said content. In any case, the Controller declares that they will proceed to immediately remove any content that may contravene Spanish or international legislation, public morals or public order, and immediately remove the redirection to that website, bringing the content in question to the attention of the relevant authorities.
                        <br>The Controller accepts no responsibility for the information and content stored, including but not limited to that stored in forums, chats, blog generators, commentaries, social networks or any other medium that allows third parties to independently post content on the Controller’s website. Nevertheless, and in compliance with the provisions in Articles 11 and 16 of the LSSI-CE, the Controller places itself at the disposal of all the users, authorities and security forces, and will actively collaborate with the removal or, if applicable, blockage of any content that may affect or contravene Spanish or international legislation, the rights of third parties or public morals or public order. In the event that the user feels that there is some content on the website that may be susceptible to this classification, he or she is asked to notify the website administrator of this immediately.
                        <br>This website has been checked and verified to ensure that it functions properly. In principle, its correct operation can be guaranteed 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Nevertheless, the Controller does not rule out the possibility of the existence of certain programming errors, or the occurrence of causes of force majeure, natural catastrophes, strikes or similar circumstances that make it impossible to access the website.
